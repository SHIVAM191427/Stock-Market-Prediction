# 📈 Stock Market Prediction with AdaBoost

This project utilizes AdaBoost Regression to predict stock market prices, incorporating key technical indicators such as RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD, and Moving Averages. The model aims to forecast stock prices, generate trading signals, and provide visualizations for future projections, enhancing decision-making in trading.

## 📌 Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Retrieval**: Fetch stock market data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.
- **AdaBoost Regressor**: Model training with hyperparameter tuning (using GridSearchCV) to optimize performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy through MSE, MAE, R², Accuracy, and F1 Score.
- **Trading Signal Generation**: Generate actionable Buy/Sell/Hold signals based on model predictions.
- **Future Price Forecasting**: Predict stock prices for a specified future time period.
- **Data Visualizations**:
  - **Actual vs. Predicted Prices**: Compare actual stock prices with predicted values.
  - **Future Price Projections**: Visualize future price predictions dynamically.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: Retrieve stock data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) using the `yfinance` library.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Integrate technical indicators such as **RSI**, **MACD**, and **Moving Averages**.  
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize features using `StandardScaler` for consistent scaling.  
4. **AdaBoost Model Training**: Train the model with **AdaBoost** using a `DecisionTreeRegressor` as the base learner.  
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters (`n_estimators`, `learning_rate`) using `GridSearchCV`.  
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess performance with metrics: **MSE**, **MAE**, **R²**, **Accuracy**, and **F1 Score**.  
7. **Signal Generation**: Generate trading signals → `"BUY"`, `"SELL"`, `"HOLD"`.  
8. **Future Price Prediction**: Forecast stock prices for the next **N** days.  
9. **Graphical Visualization**: Plot historical vs. projected stock trends.

## 🔥 Planned Enhancements
- **Deep Learning**: Integrate an **LSTM-based model** for sequential price prediction.  
- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Enable live market data for real-time predictions.  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Develop an adaptive trading strategy using RL techniques.
